This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

### Run with Docker (Recommended for development)

1. Build the Docker image:
	```powershell
	docker build -t robonyx-dev .
	```

2. Start the development container:
	```powershell
	docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 robonyx-dev
	```
	- This will mount your project folder into the container, so changes you make locally will be reflected immediately.

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
